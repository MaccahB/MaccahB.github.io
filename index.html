        <p style="font-size: 150%;">Thank you so much for visiting. This website was made entirely on my own, so forgive me for anything weird or offputting, it is a huge work in progress. I hated most protfolio sites, so I just decided to 
            learn how to make my own. Thank you again!</p>

        <p style="font-size:150%;"> Hi! My name is Makayla Norton, or also known as "Maccah Bee" on most social medias. I am a young mom, wife,and a Studio Art's major at New Mexico State University. When I have free time, which is hard 
            with a little one (currently 3 months at the time of writing this), I am constantly trying to bring to life ideas that often seem trapped inside of my own head. From a young age I have always had grand
        ideas about different characters and their stories, and now that I am older, I try to tell their stories through their designs. Concept art, for this reason, has always interested me. Gem Lim, a concept artist 
    lead at Riot Games pivoted me into this path after seeing a youtube video on the process of how characters and ideas actually come to life in the professional world. I love the looseness and creativity that gets to
shine in the intitial stages of a character, and dream everyday of being a part of that process. My favorite things to draw include villanous characters from my favorite shows and games, and pretty women!  </p>
