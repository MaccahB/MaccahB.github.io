      Hi Bee's! My website is all handmade, no templates, or anything. Its done
      entirely in visual studio code and github so it does not look the
      fanciest, but for my first website, I think it looks decent. Here you will
      find all of my art, from projects, illustrations to sketches and concepts.
      If there are any bugs or broken links please let me know, my discord is
      Maccah#1039. I would very much appreciate it.
    </p>
